# Sentiment_Analysis
This project performs binary sentiment classification on the IMDB Dataset of 50,000 movie reviews from Kaggle. The goal is to build a machine learning pipeline that automatically identifies whether a movie review expresses a positive or negative sentiment. The dataset contains 50,000 labeled reviews, with an equal number of positive and negative examples, making it a balanced and widely used benchmark for text classification tasks. 


The workflow includes:
Data loading and exploration — understanding dataset structure and distribution. 

Text preprocessing — cleaning text (removing noise and irrelevant characters) and preparing it for modeling. 

Feature extraction — converting text into numerical form using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings. 


Model training & evaluation — training classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, deep learning models) and evaluating performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices. 

Results & insights — analyzing model performance and visualizing results.
